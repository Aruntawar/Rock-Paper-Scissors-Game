# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Project Title: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (Web Version)

Objective:
Build a simple and interactive "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where a user can play against the computer in a browser. This project will help you practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for frontend development.

Project Requirements:

User Interface:

Use HTML to create buttons for user choices: "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors."
Add a display area to show the results of each round (e.g., “You chose Rock, Computer chose Scissors. You win!”).
Display current scores for the player and computer.
Include a reset button to restart the game and clear scores.
Styling (CSS):

Style the game interface for an engaging look and feel.
Create visually appealing buttons with hover effects.
Style the score display and result messages.
Consider adding animations or icons for each option (rock, paper, scissors) to enhance the design.
Game Logic (JavaScript):

Capture the user’s choice when they click a button (rock, paper, or scissors).
Generate a random choice for the computer using JavaScript.
Implement the logic to compare choices and determine the winner:
Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beat paper.
Paper beats rock.
Update and display the scores after each round.
Display a message indicating whether the user won, lost, or tied.
